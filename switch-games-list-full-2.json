      "review": "I love this game. The only thing I knew before playing Inscryption was what I gathered from a 15 second clip from one of Dunkey's best games of the year videos; mainly that it was a card game with some escape room stuff thrown in and it gets crazy. So that's about all I'm going to tell you as well. I don't really feel like it's even worth talking about the graphics, music, controls, etc (which were all fine), because really for me it was about the whole experience of playing this. There are only a few games that have ever transcended the screen and messed with my head a little bit (Portal & Last of Us come to mind) to the point where it feels more like you're watching a movie or reading a book than playing a game. Inscryption may not be as strong a game as Portal or Last of Us, but I loved the experience through and through and will remember this game a lot longer than your average hack & slash or platformer.

      "review": "Yeah, this was a kinda cool metroidvania action game. You play as this kid and then some shadow guy that follows you around does the attacking. One thing I liked a lot was after you beat certain enemies, you can use one of their moves which makes it fun to customize your character and playstyle. I also liked the art and setting of the game. It's a bit on the difficult side, but don't think it got too crazy. I'm giving it a 3 cause even though I only played it like a year ago, I really don't remember very much, so even though I enjoyed it, the game didn't stick with me very much. But if you're looking for an indie metroidvania, this is one of the better ones."

It's fairly short, and it's not a particularly challenging game, but that's not really the point. Instead you play a series of moods which are expressed through color, music, and gameplay. It's definitely the most artistic game on the list, but I highly recommend it even if that's not really your thing. It goes on sale fairly often so pick it up for cheap and beat it in a weekend. "

      "review": "I've dreamed about the day of a new Mario RPG for the longest time. I've literally had dreams about it. This was the first RPG I've ever played. I remember renting it from Blockbusters one Friday having no clue what an 'RPG' was. I jumped on the first goomba I saw and was extremely confused and frustrated. But once I got past the initial learning curve, I was hooked. I remember specifically getting stuck on Bowyer, that arrow-slinging a-hole. Fast forward, a few months later, I bought this game from my elementary school friend Nathan, and got the players guide from Nintendo Power and just chugged Mario RPG for a couple weeks straight. I beat it over and over ago, and knew the game inside and out. There were always rumors of a second Mario RPG coming out one day... and then we got Paper Mario, and part of died. \\n\n\nMario RPG is such a weird fun quirky game, the only game Nintendo (Mario) & Square (Final Fantasy) ever teamed up on. Not too soon after Mario RPG game out (it was late in the SNES lifecycle), Square abandoned Nintendo in favor of playstation, and the marriage was over. Anyways, let's talk about the game itself. It's a little of of a simplified RPG (but not totally in baby mode like Paper Mario) but Nintendo smartly throws this 'timed hits' system into the battle system to make the classic Final Fantasy RPG fight a little more active and engaging. The music is amazing (great fun themes). The characters and enemies are all diverse and rememberable. There's a big variety of minigames. And the story, though simple, is cute and compelling. You also get to team up with Bowser which is awesome. But my favorite part about the game is the large variety of secrets thrown into the game. There are hidden chests, bonus accessories and weapons, Link and Samus even make an appearance if you go to the right bed at the right time. One of my favorite little details is this random guy you can talk to behind a house. You can't see them and the conversation changes as you progress through the game if you go back to him. There's no reason or explanation to him, but he's there all the same. There are so many minor details added like this for no apparent reason. It's a very creative game that feels like it had a love of love that went into it. \\n\n\nOk, onto the remake. I enjoyed playing through Mario RPG again, but the enhanced graphics didn't really add much to the experience. Though I will say, the enhanced graphics basically match how I remember the original game looking like. But it really didn't feel like there was enough meat here for this to justify the 60 dollar price tag. There is a tiny bit of post-game content (and I mean tiny) and a few other little niceties thrown in, but none of it is all that interesting or helpful. I may have well have played the original game honestly. So what would I have done differently? Well, if there was going to be any additional content, why not lean into that a little harder. Maybe a new level for instance? They could have used enemy sprites already in game just as a different color scheme. Maybe like a tournament arena type thing if not a whole new level? Just having the extra boss battles all in one area would have been nice too. The biggest easy win though honestly would have been having a New Game+ mode. I've never played a New Game+ but I would have for Mario RPG. End of rant. Mario RPG is a great game, if you've never played it. But if you have already played it, the remake doesn't add anything new. "

      "review": "I've said this about a few games on this list, but more than any of others, do not play XCOM 2 on the Switch. Overall I'm sure it's a bit slower and clunkier than a decent PC, but there are a few missions that are almost unplayable because of the lag. I'm pretty sure the game crashed once or twice as well. The other thing I'll say about XCOM is you probably shouldn't play with the expectation that all your characters are going to make it, or that you're going to succeed in completing the game on your first go through. There is a pretty steep learning curve here. You have to really strategize carefully to use your characters efficiently and effectively. With all that out of the way, it is a really fun and deep game if you like RPGs and strategy games. The meat of the game is a sci-fi tactical RPG, but there's also a Civilization-like component where you're conquering territories, collecting resources, building up your base. And then there are quests, and research, and tons of characters to maintain and keep track of an level up. And when a character dies, that's it, they're gone. You can get away with resetting the game and restarting the mission or loading from the last save, which I definitely did more than I should have if I was trying to preserve the spirit of the game. Anyways, XCOM was fun, fairly complicated, and requires some patience and attention. Play it if you like big mission driven tactical RPGs, but don't play it on the Switch. "

I've only actually ever played one Castlevania game - Aria of Sorrow, and it seems mostly in the same ballpark. I do very much appreciate the shear amount of abilities and play styles you can try out in this game. You can basically collect different abilities from enemies and then pick which ones you want to use, which is pretty sweet. The setting is cool, music is pretty good, graphics are kinda ehh - it's got some of that early 3D polygony look to it. I'm beating around the bush though, the big detractor here is the lag on the Switch. While not god-awful, it definitely takes away from the experience, so play it somewhere else. Overall, I did enjoy the game, but there are better ones in the same genre out there. "

      "review": "So for the record, as far as 3D games go, I think Mario Odyssey is a way better game than this if you were to just pick one as a solo gamer. Compared to Odyssey, this game feels boxy, and linear. The reason I'm giving this 5/5 stars is because of the multiplayer. There are so few non-FPS coop multiplayer games, especially in the 3D platforming world. It's fun, it's chaotic, it's silly, and has a good variety of levels (the captain toad puzzles levels for instance are a nice change of pace). It's also a fairly long game as far as Mario games go, and and has some pretty challenging moments towards the end. And yes, I know this game out on the Wii-U and it would not be my top pick as far as solo games go, even with the Bowsers Fury add-on. \\n\n\nSpeaking of, let's talk about Bowsers Fury... It was alright. Honestly, I was pretty disappointed. On paper it sounds great, it takes the physics of Mario 3D world and turns it into one giant world with little islands acting more or less as levels. It's great not having the hard cut of a flag ceremony and menu screen in between levels, but as a result, I found Bowsers Fury all felt like pretty much the same level. As a whole, the whole experience was a little bland and mundane. It also suffered from the same blocky/boxyness of Mario 3D world. Still, it's Nintendo and I of course got all the Stars or Cat coins or whatever they're going with now. But yeah, Bowser's Fury, definitely not the *cats meow*\n......is this thing on? "

      "review": "I definitely applaud Sparks of Hope with taking the tactics-grid system and applying a more area based movement system to it. You still get more or less forced into a grid square, but it does feel more fluid and natural and is well done overall. The overworld is also more interesting than the first game. Each world you come across (island, artic, etc) has lots of explore and unlock, almost a bit like Mario Odyssey. It's not Mario Odyssey of course, but it still feels more open and less linear and boxy than the first Mario+Rabbids game. Beyond that, it's mostly the same game as the first with new levels. It has the same aesthetics (fun, colorful, silly, etc), and rpg elements (unlockable characters, skill-trees, etc) as the first game. The Rabbids also mostly annoyed me and I always played as the actual Mario characters if I could help it. But, like the first game, I did beat it, so I suppose that tells you something. (Though I did occasionally have to pull out the old eyeball bleach at times.)"

      "review": "Sorry Figment, but I did not enjoy you. This was one of the first games I played on my Switch. I'm pretty sure I got it for super cheap. I know it's a short game, but it got off to a slow start and I didn't feel like the puzzles were very interesting and the world not too fun to explore. However, I'm looking at images now and it looks pretty cool... So I think I owe it another shot. I probably only played it like an hour maybe? I remember the main character kept yelling at this bird which kind of bothered me for some reason. Anyways, I think the art and music were good, but maybe not executed the best way? Take this all with a grain of salt. Maybe pick it up if you want a surreal puzzle game, but I would definitely get it on sale."

      "review": "Shredder's Revenge was a fun multiplayer beat-em-up. But I felt it was a little disappointing. It doesn't quite capture the magic of the SNES classic Turtle in Time, though I think that's what they were going through. The levels weren't all that diverse or interesting, the collectables felt a little awkward and shoehorned in, and the game as a whole was on the short side. Still, it was fun to play through with friends. \\n\n\nThe beat-em-up games in the Sega and SNES era weren't perfect, but they were fun because they were new and they looked great for their age. I feel that they've not really been able to bring that genre into the modern era very well, when it seems like it would be fairly easy to do. Castle Crashers might be the best post-2000s game I've seen do it. So how do I feel about Shredder's Revenge as a whole? it was alright for a bit. But overall underwhelming and disappointing. If you're looking for a short coop to play with friends, this might be up there on the list, but only because that's a pretty short list. "

It has a similar type of game play to Hades - the overhead action beat-em-up kinda thing, except that its cyberpunk-y and not a rougelike. That sounds great, except the combat and upgrade systems were not all that intuitive and the levels and maps were dark and opaque. Maybe there's just a bit of a learning curve or hump that I needed to get over, but I just did not find myself very engaged with Transistor but instead more confused and annoyed.

      "review": "This is the only Mario Party game I've ever actually owned. I've never been a big Mario Party person, but it's fun to play in a casual setting with friends. I don't think this is the cream of the crop as far as Mario Party games go. The overworld is needlessly confusing. It kind of feels like there are too many coins compared to stars. I don't think I was ever limited to buy a star by the number of coins. One new mode I did like was when the levels opened it up so you could play on a grid instead of a path. This was a cool new addition. The only problem was if you wanted to land on a certain space, you often needed to roll either an even or odd number, even if you got near the space long before the other team. \\n\nBut yeah, I had fun with the game for a bit, and I'd always be willing to put it out if I had people over who wanted to play. That said, I think there are better multiplayer games, including other Mario Party games."

It's a roguelike at heart, but the combat is just super tight, and the different combinations of weapons available and blessings randomized throughout a run keep the game endlessly interesting. Music, and graphics are good, artstyle and lore are really cool. And there is just an insane amount of really well done voice acting and dialogues which never really got old for me. So yeah, super fun game, but at the end of the day, it is really is just 4 levels repeated endlessly. "

I did have a great time playing through them all with friends, but mostly because it was with friends. The online experience worked pretty well and the games are well suited for the co-op experience. But as far as the franchise itself, I'm not actually a huge fan. The art-style is meh, the humor is stupid, the story is whatever, and the missions are all pretty generic. There's also just way too much gear that is mostly all kind of the same. And the rare items are way too rare to the point where you barely ever find any - and if you do they might not work for your character, and they'll be obsolete in a level or two anyways. So yeah, it's fun as a co-op game, but as far as other post-apocalyptic first person shooter/rpgs (*cough* fallout), this doesn't even come close. "

Unfortunately with apartment living I've not been able to play this as much as I would like. FYI make sure you have decently high ceilings and some space around you when playing. Again, for a fitness game it's pretty fun. It's basically an RPG where you fight goofy enemies like dumbbells and kettlebells with some minigames thrown in there. It's not amazing, but it's fun while you're exercising. "

However, I thought the graphics, music and gameplay were just alright. The best part for me was trying to string together different moves to get your combo score as high as possible. There are a few challenging sections thrown in if you're going for the completionist factor. But yeah, as a whole, it was a fun solid Metroidvania, but nothing above and beyond. "

It's a tactics game in the most purest of forms - existing somewhere on the line between Final Fantasy Tactics and Chess. You're often working with units that have like 2 health and deal 1 damage. But some attacks have things like knockback which can add more damage, so you're constantly having to do more with less and really think through each turn. The game also has some roguelike features. As you beat each series of levels you can unlock different starter units, each with their own abilities. Definitely pick this one up, it's great!"

It feels pretty similar to the original Streets of Rage games for Sega so they did a good job there. But like I said, I didn't get super far, but seems to play well as a classic arcade beat-em-up. "

      "review": "If you're looking for 2D modern platformers for the Switch, this is definitely one of the better ones. I'd say it's slightly better than the first Donkey Kong Country Returns. You don't have the blow mechanic anymore (thank god!) and it's just more polished and exciting overall. The levels are often very engaging and interactive, whether you're being chased in a mine cart or making your way through a fruit factory. As was the case with the first DKCR, this game is pretty hard through and through. It doesn't just save the tough levels for the very end like Mario does. I think it was the second secret level I found, \"Bopopolis\", where I easily died over 100 times before beating it. (Maybe wine and dine me a bit first, good lord...) But overall I enjoyed the challenge since 100%ing this game is tough, but not impossible.\n\nNow, let's get real here for a moment. Yes, this is a good game, but no it's not as good as the original Donkey Kong Country games. I feel like your movement is really restricted with both the new DKCR games. Why does my jump feel so low? I really enjoyed the freedom of movement in the original DKC games. Plus, the atmosphere and vibes just feel off to me with the Return games. Everything's just a little too pretty and just-so. The original DKC game had this warm organic feel with amazing atmospheric music that you just don't get with Tropical Freeze. And why the heck is Cranky all happy now? Is he on pills or something? Also, I didn't mention, but yes, there are 4 different characters you can play as in Tropical Freeze and they all play slightly different. Now if only they played a little more like the original Diddy and Dixie..."

      "review": "I've waited so long for this game -- a brand new Sonic game completely the style of the original Sonic games... It looks, sounds, and feels just like you're playing one of the Genesis games (matching most directly to Sonic 3). Most of the level themes are borrowed from one of the original games (even Sonic CD), though there are a handful of new ones as well. \\n\n\nOk, background... I got a Sega Genesis for my birthday in 1st grade with one game... Sonic the Hedgehog. The next year I got Sonic 2 for my birthday, and Sonic 3 the following year. Those were the only games I had for years.  I've beat them dozens of times at different points in my life (Sonic & Knuckles and Sonic CD came a little later for me). Anyways, I think I've earned my Sonic stripes and am qualified to criticize Sonic Mania a bit... \\n\n\nFirst off, I liked Sonic Mania a lot. I beat it with all the different characters, beat all the bonus stages, blah blah blah, 100% completion. I didn't loooove Sonic Mania all the way through though. I'm a big fan of the original Sonic the Hedgehog which is a slower paced, more explorey type game compared to the later ones. The old Sonic games were always great because you could get familiar with each level, but still find new paths and secrets later one. Sonic Mania levels were so vast though it was hard to ever get any sort of familiarity. Looking for emeralds and trying to backtrack and explore can be kind of frustrating when each level is a winding maze set up for you to sprint through. The next is a personal gripe that most of the level themes they chose to imitate were not my favorite stages - I know that's personal, so I'll let it slide. There were a couple new playable characters which was cool, but I kind of wish they took a little liberty to go farther in terms of experimenting  with mechanics. One thing I would have loved to see are more item boxes. Sonic 3 may not have been as strong a game as 1 or 2 level-wise, but the bubble, fire, and lightening shields you can get are a super fun addition. I think they really missed the chance to explore that mechanic. Extra shields? Shield combos? Backup shields? Vegetable shield? I think that's enough on Sonic Mania. I still have like 20 games to review..."

It has a very charming, creative aesthetic that I didn't quite 'get', but they really take it and run with it to the maximum effect. The levels go for this cardboard, DIY crafted thing, kind of in the realm of a school play. Each time you beat a level, you could play the same level in reverse; not just backwards, but like actually reverse. Imagine if the camera rotates 180° into the screen and now you're on the backside of the level, revealing what's been behind trees and other random level obstacles. These extra levels usually involved searching for certain items, kind of like playing eye-spy. This did get a little old for me, but it was still a really cool part of the game. \\n\n\nSo I liked this game probably more than most people that are over the age of 12 would. It was clever and fun, but the baby-ish aesthetic did ware on me. Also, it felt like there was only like one song in the entire game. There were variations of it, sure, but yeah - that really got old. I'm honestly not sure there was a second song. So yeah, a game that had some really well done parts that was made for same target audience of Ms. Rachel. "

You could upgrade your cards and swap out cards for others, but I guess it didn't feel as flushed out as it could have been. The combat and enemies were decent but the levels themselves felt pretty flat. Each area was segmented into a little rectangle that made exploration pretty minimal. I played through the whole game and it was fun, but nothing too special overall. "

But in my defense I only gave it a 5 because it wouldn't let me enter in a 6. TBH I was surprised how much I enjoyed playing through the original Doom again. And then I went on and played through several of the add-ons. There are soooooo many levels. And they get haaaaard. I definitely abused the save/load feature 🤷🏻‍♀️. There's something extremely satisfying about killing old school demons with a double barrel shotgun. I just love the sounds in this game too - the deaths, the gun shots, even the doors opening/closing. I could go on... this is one of the best game and well made games of all time. While playing through newer games on this list, I found myself thinking - 'yeah, this is pretty good, but look at what Doom was doing 30 years ago!'. I know it's a tough comparison but its good to have some standards - A north star to help guide us and remind us to RIP AND TEAR!"

I was only barely aware of what Dynasty Warriors was before diving into this, but in my head, it involved strategy and tactics and capturing bases... that kinda thing. Instead the only \"strategy\" I ever used was to press \"A\" over and over again. There are bosses and different playable characters and that kinda thing, but it's all kind of the same. It's a dumb game where you just zone out kill enemy after enemy. Don't get me wrong, I played through the whole thing... but you kinda get the idea after one level of this. "

      "review": "Yooka-Laylee was one of the first games I played on the Switch and it was prettttty good. Solid B. I particularly liked the world map. You can explore it, interact with things, there are secrets, etc. It's like somewhere in between the Mario 3 and Banjo Kazooie overworld map. But anyways, let's get into the actual game. It's a 2D platformer, pretty similar in style to Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze. And its prettttttttttty good. As you can maybe tell from the amount of 't's I'm puttttting in words, I liked the game, but I didn't love the game. Which is a little disappointing because I love Banjo Kazooie, and I love 2D classic platformers. I think the levels themselves were just a bit hit or miss. They had some fun, inspired moments, but also a lot of mediocre ones as well. The controls just always felt a little stiff as well. But it's been a few years and I'm having trouble remembering specifics. I enjoyed Yooka Laylee, but I was also ready for it to be over when it was. "

      "review": "So, I love Pokemon Snap. It's such a dumb, fun, silly game. And the new one was fun too. Of course it ended up being the same rail mechanics of original game, where you ride around on a set course chucking apples and playing the poke-flute over and over (Man, does that song get old). But it still has a certain charm and lack of pretension which I really appreciate. Of course the dream of Pokemon Snap, and really all Pokemon games is to be able to walk around in an open world with the pokemon just out and about. One might think that 25 years after the original Pokemon Snap game came out, they'd be able to do that by now. If in another 25 years a new Pokemon Snap with the same rail mechanics comes out again, I will be so disappointed, but I'll probably still buy it. "

Worms Armageddon came along, and I enjoyed that as well. Years later, out comes WMD... and it was fine? Games like this always make me wonder if I'm fantasizing about the past with nostalgia colored glasses, or if the newer version just isn't as good. I'd venture to say in this case, some of both. Certainly the novelty of being young and playing violent ridiculous games like this for the first time was a big part of the appeal. But Worms WMD doesn't offer anything new that's particularly exciting or interesting either. It's really just the same Worms 2/Worms Armageddon game again, this time with some vehicles thrown in. And the vehicles feel pretty clunky and awkward to use. It's disappointing they haven't found a way to improve the basic games slow pacing and sluggish movement. I played it a few times with friends and had fun, but there just really wasn't enough there to make it worth many replays or exploring the single player missions. "

      "review": "Metroid Dread is possibly the most disappointing game I played on the Switch. Not because it was terrible, it was overall pretty decent, but because I had high expectations for it. After playing Nintendo games like Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey, Metroid Dread feels a bit like an afterthought. It plays very well, and looks & sounds pretty good good, but doesn't at all go beyond the original 2D Metroid games. The new mechanics - mostly these robots that kill you instantly if you get to close to them are frustrating to deal with. You will die a lot dealing with these guys. I think Dunkey put it well when he said Metroid Dread is simultaneously too confusing while being too linear. Whenever you get a new ability, it's not at all obvious where you're supposed to go, so you have to search the whole map to find that one place you now have access to. Overall, I would still recommend it if you like the Metroid series, though you may get more enjoyment just going back and playing Metroid for the SNES. "

The info was overwhelming, navigating through the controls was confusing, the characters all kind of seemed the same... and yeah, it lagged a lot right off the bat. Maaaaaaaybe if they work out the kinks in an update I'll revisit this, but this game has some serious stink on it, so probably not. "

      "review": "LIMBO was a lot darker and creepier than I thought it would be - in a good way. It's a bit of a platformer/puzzle game all in black and white. The creatures and accompanying soundscape all make for a kind of eerie, unsettling experience - again in a good way. It's definitely on the shorter side, but often goes on sale I think for like 2 bucks. All in all it's a nice little indie game with a horror inspired theme. "

      "review": "Owlboy plays well on the Switch. It doesn't lag, or have frame rate drops, or crash. And crazy enough, that's a big plus compared to a lot of games on the Switch. Unfortunately, that's probably the best part about Owlboy. On paper, it seems like this should be a pretty good game, but I just never found it very enjoyable. The story is generic, the levels are boring, the characters and dialogues are annoying. Graphics and music are decent, and you can fly everywhere which is kind of cool. But playing Owlboy always felt like a chore. I can't put my finger on exactly what was missing here. It's kind of a cute little adventure game, but I just did not find it very enjoyable. 2 out of 5 hoots."

If you want a light hearted whimsical adventure/rpg you should definitely play this -- just don't play it on the Switch."

      "review": "Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the second best 3D platformer that I've played, after Mario Odyssey. And to be fair, it's not nearly as good as Mario Odyssey. But it's still really good! It's just a fun game. The levels are bright and colorful and I love exploring each ability and trying to get good with each of them. There's a hub world with some minigames; those were all ok. You can also level up Kirby's abilities which was satisfying, but I had kinda mixed feelings about. Level's are fairly linear with some hidden stuff along the way. One unexpected area this game really excelled at is the boss battles. They are epic, and actually get pretty hard at the end. It's not a super long game, but if you can get it on sale, I definitely recommend it."

I really enjoyed the movement of the main character, and just how fast you can sprint around the world. You find all sorts of NPC characters throughout the world, each of which is a different animal. There are quests and abilities to unlock, almost like a mini-zelda game. It's also setup from the perspective of a DIY, pretend adventure game - all the enemies are cardboard for instance. It is a short game as I mentioned above, but it's a super fun game to 100% complete. Also, the story and dialogues are very charming and cute. "

This may be the only video game that I actually find funny. It's so over the top and absurd, but it also has a kind of slapstick corny charm. There is a good amount of customization you can do with your character both in terms of build and dialogue options. There is a narrator who you can sometimes disagree with, leading to strange meta-game goofiness. There are bird chirps that sometimes sing to the music. The RPG elements are also done pretty well here; there are places to explore, stuff to collect, strange enemies to fight. It's not a game for everyone, but if you want a light-hearted funny RPG, check this stick out. "

      "review": "Breath of the Wild is one of the best games you can get on the Switch and the reason many people buy a Switch. It's also my favorite Zelda game since Link to the Past on the SNES. You're given all your abilities in the first couple hours of the game, and at that point, you're allowed to go wherever you want. I loved just running around, exploring and collecting things across the open world of Hyrule. The music is atmospheric and really captures the mood of the game. Breath of the Wild also forces you to experiment and try different weapons and gear. All your weapons break fairly quickly so you need to constantly cycle through different equipment. This might feel a little overwhelming, but you get used to it quick and the interfaces are done well. It's an impressive game, physics-wise. Just about everything is done in-game, with limited cutscenes. In some of the boss area's the entire structure you're in can be rotated. Usually this would be done in a cutscene in a game during which they'd switch out one map for another, but in BOTW everything happens in real time. It's really cool and definitely messes with your perspective. You can jump off any mountain and hang-glide anywhere you want, or shield surf down any hill or mountain (one of my favorite things to do). Whenever I play another open world game now, I'm always wishing I could glide or shield surf. \\n\n\nI'm also impressed that BOTW can be totally open world without being an RPG. There are some RPG elements like collecting heart pieces or enhancing your gear, but the rest is up to you.  It's not a perfect game though. One gripe that I had was that the temples were often very similar with one another. And there are a loooot of temples. But overall, this was a great game that is still fun to run around and fight monsters in even after you beat the game. "

      "review": "Ok, I know I owe Rayman another chance - I did not get very far. This was my first time playing any Rayman game, but man, I just did not like it. I suppose you could say, that everyone DOESN'T like Rayman... (crickets). \\n\n\nAnyways, I found the overworld confusing, though the levels themselves seemed alright. But I think it was the graphics and art style that really did it in for me. There was something almost nauseating about the characters and visuals that was reminiscent of The Stinky Cheeseman book. Maybe the level design and game mechanics are spectacular... maybe (they seemed fine so far). And maybe the best tasting burger in the world looks like a dog turd. I don't know, but I'm not eating it. "

      "review": "I don't really get the Rabbids. I guess they're sort of like Minions, which I also don't really get. But I didn't hate them as much as I thought I would, though I definitely almost exclusively played as the Mario cast rather than the Rabbid Mario dress-up characters. It's a pretty fun tactics rpg game with a good amount of exploration and puzzles thrown in in-between levels. The weapon selection isn't super exciting, as you just want to pick the one that does the most damage, but there's a bit of customization you can do with each character in terms of leveling up and skill-trees. The overworld is vast with lots of explore/unlock but also can feel a little sprawling and confusing. The rabbid cutscenes and bosses are all waaaaay over the top, and I felt torn between being entertained and wanting to bleach my eyeballs. I did complete it, and I did buy the next game in the series, so I guess the entertaining part won out, though I still felt like I could use some bleach eyedrops as times. "

It takes some of the most twisted and gruesome parts of western religion and subverts them further to build the world this game takes place in. The bosses and NPCs are some of the most creepy creatures imaginable. The music is great, and the pixel graphics are too. \n\nIt's a bit of a slow paced game in terms of your movements and attacks, compared to other recent Metroidvanias. Every action you take must be very deliberate. The game's tends to be on the difficult side, but never gets insanely challenging. The enemy actions can be a little predictable and I did find myself confused on how to progress at times - but overall this is probably my second favorite modern Metroidvania game, second only to Hollow Knight."

      "review": "So I finally got around to playing Shovel Knight, and it was amazing! It's like medieval, silly megaman with great controls and music. Besides Shovel Knight, there were 3 other games here too where you play as some of the bosses each in their own separate adventure. There is a bit of a learning curve for each of them, with the Plague Knight being the most challenging. The graphics and artstyle are definitely in the mold of the NES, but it feels like a brand new game; not something trite or redundant. Each level is fun to play both fast and slow, either sprinting through, or taking your time and exploring. All 4 games were very good, though I did prefer Shovel Knight classic the best. The 3 other adventures, I did like, but also had some mixed feelings about (annoying to change Plague Knights abilities, Specter Knight felt imprecise, etc). Overall, game as a whole was great, though its 40 bucks so maybe wait til there's a sale."

      "review": "Celeste is a simple that is executed extremely well. The art style and music are shrouded in retro pixelated love without feeling cheesy or derivative. Character movement feels super tight which is definitely needed because this game gets haaaaard. It's a challenging game with a story about overcoming personal challenges - so smart! There aren't a lot of scenes or dialog in the game, but what was there I found very powerful and moving. \n\nI can't really talk about this game without talking about the difficulty aspect. As I mentioned above, this is a tough game and you will die a lot. I didn't really find it frustrating though, maybe because there weren't really any cheap kills or gotcha mechanics thrown in. There are also constant save points, so you are really just clearing one room at a time. I definitely 100% complete this game, but then again, I'm not sure anyone actually has. So if I like this game so much, why not give it a 5? Well, I'm trying to really reserve those... but maybe I should. I don't really have any 'dings' against the game - maybe it could have been a little longer? Why I'm keeping it 4 is mostly the lack of innovation and a \"wow\" factor. At the end of the day, it's just another 2D platformer with really good music. It just happens to be one of the best 2D platformers with really good music. "

      "review": "So I played Valfaris for a bit and Slain hardly at all. I really enjoyed Valfaris, it's like a 2D platformer shooter where you collect different weapons and can level them up a bit along the way. It gets difficult pretty quick but there are plenty of checkpoints so you never have to backtrack too much. I always thought the main character looked kinda like John Romero which makes sense for a bloody shooter where you use giant guns. Anyways, Valfaris was fun, though I didn't finish it. I didn't really give Slain much of a chance, but I didn't love it right away. I think this duo pack goes on sale pretty often, so if you like indie retro bloody platformers, this is a pretty good get. "

      "review": "Game Freak has basically been making the same Pokemon game every few years since the original Red/Blue versions. Now that I type all that out, I kind of wish more games would do this - I would love a basic Mario or Sonic 2D platformer every other year. But I don't feel that way about Pokemon. Every Pokemon game I've played feels simultaneously fun but disappointing. I definitely enjoy the collecting and leveling up/evolving aspect, but it's that same old crusty battle system that really needs a makeover. The best new feature in Sword/Shield was definitely the open area more or less in the middle of the map. I hope this is an indication of the direction they're going with the new games. Being able to walk around and explore big open worlds and see and catch Pokemon in the wild has always been the dream. That and them switching to more an action rpg system rather than the turn based.\\n While I'm here, here's another big gripe I have with these games. I breeze through the main game because you fight trainers who literally pick a random move with no strategy whatsoever. Then I get to the after game challenge section and I get destroyed. And I realize all along I was supposed to be caring about all these hidden variables like EVs and I should have been leveling up my Pokemon slowly, only fighting the right enemies, etc. There's no way I'm putting in the effort for all that, but why is there no middle ground between these 2 extremes of difficulty and playstyle?"

I guess that's about it honestly. Of course, as is JRPG tactics tradition, the dialogue goes on wayyyy too long. It's mostly skippable, and you better believe I was smashing that skip button because I stopped caring about the story after maybe the 2nd mission. Combat is very reminiscent of Shining Force - one of my favorite Sega games. However, there is no world to explore. It's just chatting and fighting. I was warned that this game gets tough, and I definitely died a few times (but you can just restart the mission). It's not a game you can really grind your way up a few levels as there are no random enemy battles. However, there are a couple arenas within certain levels where you can squeeze out a good amount of XP for characters you care about. So yeah, if you have the Switch Advanced membership and access to the GBA software, check this one out for a good tactics game. "

There are 3 parts to this game: The main game, a bunch of mini games you can unlock, and a short bonus game where you play as a different character. Kirby always kind of makes for an awkward character to play a platformer with. He's so floaty and sluggish that it's often just easier to fly over most of the level rather than play through it the \"normal way\". Return to Dreamland was definitely on the easy side, and honestly I was kind of sick of it about halfway through. It picked up a bit at the end though. The minigames were pretty expansive, almost rivaling Mario Party and probably would be pretty fun in a group. I also really liked the bonus game which I played after beating the main game. You play as one of the enemy characters - I don't remember which one, and slowly gain back their strength. It's short, but I kind of liked it more than then main game. "

      "review": "Yoku's Island Express was a really cute interesting take on pretty much a Metroidvania type of game. The hook here is that you're playing pinball. You play as Yoku (who is a bug or something I think?) and also acts as the pinball itself. You have some control over left/right movement and can maybe jump I think?  But then you also have the paddles where you have to flick poor Yoku up series of winding paths and ramps. It can be fun, and it can also be a little repetitive or annoying at times, since you have to replay tricky parts several times if you fall from a ways up. But it's a pretty short game and never super difficult or anything. And it's bright, colorful, unique, charming, with some pretty catchy music. I hope they make another one, since it is a pretty unique style of play and I think a little bit of fine-tuning and game expansion could go a long way. "

      "review": "So, TBH I did not finish this game. It seems like online people tend to like this game more than Doom 2016. But for me, the fast paced, low overhead magic that existed in Doom 2016 was kind of stripped away here. Yes, the action is still intense, and the music and art and gameplay is still awesome. But right away, the first thing that appears on the home screen is the game prompting you to sign into your Bethesda account. I forget if you have to do this to play or not, but I think you might. And then the overworld has you on this big ship that feels a little confusing and a lot of boring. There's also a lot more story in this game, and I found it a good deal harder right off the bat. Something about those combinations of things made me lose my appetite for demon slaying. Instead of fast paced slaughtering, I found myself teetering between boredom and frustration. I have been meaning to pick this back up, and maybe it gets better as the game goes on. But having just come from Doom 2016, I was pretty disappointed. "

      "review": "Yeah... go ahead and take my 5 star rating TOTK. Let's start with the positives - It's a better story than BOTW, with slightly better gameplay than the first game and impressive physics. You can create vehicles, seesaws, crazy weapons, traps, whatever you want really - though the crafting system can be tedious and imprecise. I love how much of the game they keep in the in-game engine. You don't create a vehicle or pulley system to move some guy around and then cutscene magic happens. Everything happens within the engine of the game. It's definitely impressive. The game is also huge with 3 layers of maps stacked on top of one another. You got your normal walkin' around part with villages, you got your sky islands, and then you got your huge underground cave area. What's great about these new Zelda games is how fun it is to just mess around, explore, and experiment \\n\n\nNow onto why I gave this a reluctant 5/5. Yes, it is bigger and better than BOTW, but why oh why did they choose to set the game in the exact same location only like 10 years in the future. I know there are sky islands and underground caves, but the main map is the same map as the last game! That's really my main issue, is that in the 6 years between games, why did they keep so many things the same. You explore the same towns, you fight the 4 bosses, then you fight Ganondorf. Another gripe is that the underground world is so big but so homogenous. It's beautiful and eerie and there's some cool stuff down there, but there's also a lot of areas that all look and feel exactly the same. So yeah, great game, fun game, but for god sake please give us a new map with less caves for the next game."

      "review": "Sonic Origins is basically a collection of 5 games - Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles, and Sonic CD. These are some of my absolute favorite games, and in my estimation, some of the best 2D platformers ever. The extra stuff on Sonic Origins besides the huge collection of concept art is essentially negligible. The achievements and challenges feel like they're tossed in last minute, and the overworld menu is pretty blah. I did of course get all the achievements and played through each game twice. The games all play great (not always the case for 3rd party Switch games), and you can change the resolution if you want to be a purist. The game I was far most excited for was Sonic CD as I've only played through that game once back when I was a teenager. Sonic CD plays most similarly to Sonic 1. It has a darker aesthetic than the other games, and the music is amazing. The bonus levels and time travel stuff was a little annoying though. Sometimes you'd accidentally travel to the future because you couldn't stop running. But Sonic CD really focuses on exploring each level which I appreciated. \\n\n\nI was never sure which of the original Sonic game was my favorite - I liked the pacing of 1, the epicness of 2, the bonus shields of 3, and the narrative of S&K. However playing though each one twice in a row this time around helped shed some clarity on that pondery. So, ranking the Sonic games (drumroll....) goes as such. #1) Sonic 2 - it's not perfect but it is such a fun full game with a big variety of levels. #2) Sonic 1 - I love this game so much. It's the slowest paced game of the Sonics, but I really love exploring each level. #3) Sonic 3 - Love the shield upgrades. Takes the physics of Sonic 2 and makes them a little tighter, but feels a little short. #4) Sonic CD - the time travel stuff can be a little frustrating, but it's also very satisfying exploring and saving the future of each stage. #5) Sonic & Knuckles - I know that you can play 3 into Sonic & Knuckles - which I usually do. And I do like getting all the hyper emeralds for the different characters. Why it's my least favorite has to do with the levels - there's a claustrophobic-ness and a segmentation to the stages that overall make the game less enjoyable than the others. "

There's a bit of that here with Pokemon Unite, but as far as free games go, this is one of the better ones. It's basically taking the old DOTA/League of Legends one team vs another format and simplifying/shortening it. I enjoyed this game for a few weeks and it's kind of fun with friends too. What is a little annoying with games in this type of DOTA format, is that the strategy to win becomes so specific (at minute 2 go here, and minute 5 down here, etc) So that can get a little frustrating and a little old. But I still enjoyed this game for a couple weeks. "

      "review": "I love that video games like TOEM exist nowadays. This is a great end of the night kind of game that is low stakes, only requiring some light puzzle solving. The basic concept is you go around and take pictures of things to progress through the levels. Sometimes it's just about exploring and looking for a certain object, and other times it's more about convincing some guy to move out of the way. It's cute and quirky, without getting too over the top or meta. I really liked the artstyle and general vibes of TOEM. It just kind of put me in a chill, laid back mood. And it's a game you can play for 5 minutes or an hour; there's no real commitment cost. It's a fairly short game, and some of the photo quests were more interesting than others, but if you can pick this up on sale, I'd highly recommend TOEM. "

Gameplay was good, graphics were good, but nothing was great. I also have some mixed feelings about the artstyle and aesthetics. It's like robot steampunk but kind of cheesy?

      "review": "This game was ok. I liked the half roguelike, half farm simulator idea, but the fighting part was definitely a lot more fun than the farming part. Combat mechanics and gameplay were pretty good (not amazing), but the farming aspect just got pretty stale -- having to collect everything and all that. I did enjoy the cult spin on everything. You had these little animal followers who you could brainwash, sacrifice, resurrect, etc. And all the sprites were pretty cute. The biggest downfall though was that the game crashed several times and towards the very end got a little sluggish. So, gotta subtract a point for that from what could have been a decent game. Maybe plays better on the computer? I dunno, it's not like it's a must play either way. "

      "review": "Oof, this game was disappointing. I remember loving the first Axiom Verge. That game, along with Hallow Knight and others got me obsessed with Metroidvania games for a few years. The new mechanics in Axiom Verge 2 are more annoying than interesting - the big one being launching a little robot guy you can control. The overall mode and style just seems like it's missing something. It's not as fun and quirky as the first game, instead it feels more dry and sterile. That said, if you like Metroidvanias, this one plays well on the switch a will be a decent play. It just won't be a great play. "

      "review": "I enjoyed this game for a bit, but got tired of it pretty quick. I guess the combat was alright, but I was never too big into these types of 1v1 fighting games. Some of the extra bits, like the unlockable costume parts and the huge dungeon where you run around and open chests of more unlockables seemed compelling at first, but ultimately ended up feeling like hollow gimmicks. All the backstories and cutscenes with the characters in the one-player mission mode, I just really didn't care about. The story I think seemed to involve family drama mixed with like time traveling aliens or something? Does anyone care about that stuff in a fighting game? Why don't they just try and make the game good? "

      "review": "Ok now we're dealing with the big boys. We're talking big boy stuff here. But really though, this is maybe the best game on the Switch. (I feel like I've compared just about every other game on this list to Odyssey.) The levels have this nice open feeling that promote exploration and experimentation, inspired greatly by one of the greatest Mario games, Mario 64. The big issue I had with the 3D Mario games that came out in between 64 and Odyssey (ie Mario Galaxy) was how linear, segmented, and boxed in they all felt. In Mario Odyssey you get these nice big boy levels you can just play around in. Triple jump into a wall jump into a dive, long jump off a cliff and save yourself by throwing your hat into an enemy. Oh yeah, the big new thing with Mario Odyssey is that you can throw your hat into things and change into them. Some are definitely more fun than others (gliding lizard > tree). My favorite was the caterpillar. \\n\n\nBut the best part of the game in my opinion was the freedom of movement in the levels. It's a sizable game with over 800 moons to collect, but it's not a giant game as far as modern games go. I honestly could have used another level or 2. One other thing just to gripe on is the music in most of these modern Nintendo games. I really feel like the best Mario music came out on the NES and SNES, I credit this to the severe limitations of the hardware at the time. Because they couldn't have many layers of instruments or even many different timbres or sounds, old Mario games had these amazing unique catchy themes, often in this spastic ragtime style. Where as with the new games, where possibilities of orchestration and timbres are endless, Nintendo music often focuses more on instrumentation, layers, and symphonic textures. One exception is the Stream Gardens theme. That's just a fun tune. I know this is mostly a preference of aesthetics, but I really don't care much for this professional symphonic sound so many of the levels seemed to have. Anyways, great game, maybe the best game on the Switch. Pretty much a must have. "

It plays really well, and with the missions being so short, it's pretty fun trying to sprint through each of them and get the platinum score in each level. I wasn't all that interested in the inbetween level conversations and gift giving with the other characters, though there were some extra levels you could unlock, and I did like the cat that smoked a cigar. Online, I felt like people were pretty stoked about the gameplay, which was fun, but I wasn't blown away by any of it. Was it really doing anything that much more innovative than Doom was 30 years ago (besides jumping)?"

I played this on steam a while back and after watching some friends play it recently, I thought \"yeah, that looks fun, why did I stop playing that?\" And then I played it, and I remembered why. I really like the idea of dice mechanics in RPG combat and I think this could have been expanded upon more in interesting ways. But while Dicey Dungeons may be fun the first time or 2 playing through, it gets old pretty quick. It's a fairly short game without a ton of variety. And I really don't like the graphics or music at all. But if you're bored with 20 min to kill I suppose there are worst ways to spend your time. "

I only played this game a little with some friends online and it was pretty fun. The game played well, and its a good game to chat with pals while building up a little campsite/looking for berries/running from eyeball monsters. I've always found Don't Starve to be a pretty challenging game and I've never been able to get super far, but I've always enjoyed the times I've played it."

      "review": "I mean, Mario Kart is one of the reasons you buy the Switch. Yes, I'm aware this came out on the Wii-U, and yes it's annoying that to play the new roster of extra levels you need to be a Switch Online+ (or whatever it's called) subscriber, but it's still one of the best multiplayer games out there that's always fun to come back to. It's also one of the only modern Multiplayer games that just about everyone can enjoy, from skilled players to filthy casuals. I was a bit overwhelmed at first with all the loops and the colors and the hovering and the flying and the jello pudding cups (sorry don't know what came over me), but I got used to it pretty quick. So yeah, Mario Kart is a Nintendo classic for a reason, dating back to the SNES, and it's basically expected to have this in your collection. "

      "review": "I did not love Tunic, but I did appreciate Tunic. It's a game that kind of takes a while to see the real payoff. I would describe Tunic as kind of a puzzle adventure game. It plays a tiny bit like an isometric Zelda Link to the Past, but finding where to go next and how to proceed is the tricky and at times frustrating part. But the game play is not where the real magic of Tunic lies. That instead lies in the layers of secrets and hidden codes/messages throughout the game. The main gimmick is that you're collecting pieces of an instruction manual or player's guide on how to play tunic throughout the world. You find the pages in a seemingly random order and a lot of the instructions are in a made up language that only through context, and images can you kind of figure out what you're supposed to be doing. You will run into a lot of dead ends and that can be pretty confusing, but it can also be incredibly rewarding figuring out some puzzle or secret from deciphering the instructions. (Side note: the instruction manual is the cutest instruction manual of all time.) I definitely did not figure out all the puzzles or get all the collectables as the secrets go deep. Even some of the music had secret messages decoded in them, but I think you needed outside tools to decipher it. Anyways, it was a cool game, but also a challenging game that takes some patience. "

      "review": "Oh how I love to make mario levels. You know, there are a lot of jobs out there that I think, 'yeah I could probably do that'. Most of the time I'm wrong, like very very wrong. But I really do think I would be a great level designer. My biggest problem with Mario Maker is the user submitted levels and the interface used to navigate through this ocean of human garbage they call user created levels. It is so hard to find good levels on here. It's just a cluster of madness. One issue is that novelty and insanity is greatly rewarded among the user levels so that the most extreme levels receive the most attention and are the easiest to find. This means levels with qualities like nuance, playability, and fun are pushed to the side. If you are willing to dig there are some great user submitted levels with a lot of heart. But along the way you will find a lot of 'Xtreme' challenges, and levels where you literally don't press any buttons called 'autoplay'. Really, that's a whole category. Are these fun after trying one of them? \\n\n\nOh yeah, the level editor is great by the way. I just wish the level browser was as well. "

It's pretty amazing that in every single level they find a unique way to transform the level into a ridiculous psychedelic experience whenever you nab a wonder seed. Sometimes you'd turn into an enemy, sometimes the entire levels perspective would change, and sometimes there'd be a whole musical number. It's pure madness, but at the same time, it still captures the fun, classic 2D mario experience similar to the New Super Mario bros games that came out on Wii. And sure the original Mario 3 for the NES is still my favorite Mario game, and sure part of me wishes Nintendo would forgo all the gimmicks and just make a really good classic Mario game with better graphics and a ton of levels. But then I saw dancing singing piranha plants. And that's why I like Gremlins 2 more than Gremlins 1... Sorry, what was I talking about? Gremlins singing \"New York New York\"? Ohhh Mario Wonder, my bad. Yeah, that game was fun. And it's multiplayer, and challenging at the end. And it's silly, like very silly. Maybe too silly...? Nahhhh"

      "review": "SteamWorld Heist is definitely my favorite of the SteamWorld games I've played. It's a 2D tactics RPG, a pretty rare genre type that I wish more games did more of. You collect and unlock different characters and weapons as you progress and each level can be explored for gold and treasure. I loved trying out all the different characters as I tried to keep them all around the same level. My favorite was the melee fish robot. The game wasn't exactly hard, but it wasn't easy either. I really did have to plan my team and think about each move. I enjoyed all the different characters you encounter, but felt like there was an overkill of dialogue. I also did not care for the music they played at the saloons/shops, but I suppose that's more of a personal gripe. "

      "review": "This game definitely took some getting used to. It's not nearly as straightforward and polished as the original Chrono Trigger, which already wasn't very straightforward. Also, this game is going to feel nothing like the original Chrono Trigger just fyi. I felt like I was constantly confused with Chrono Cross on where I'm supposed to be going. And I couldn't even begin to follow the story. Of course being for the original playstation, these graphics aged like a fine cheese. There are also some weird new combat mechanics thrown in which don't feel like they add that much. \n\nSo is there anything redeeming about this worthless piece of crap of a game that I'm describing? Well yeah actually, and maybe try and mellow out a bit (yikes!) The best parts about this game come down to variety in character choices and all secrets there are to discover. See there are a ton of characters all over the place in this game. Finding them can depend on what year you're in and your previous actions. There are a ton that I did not find. But I had a lot of fun trying out and experimenting with the ones that I did. Some of them even evolve! (What does that remind me of...) So yeah, it's a quirky game with a lot of mystery. But with a little bit of patience, Chrono Cross can be a pretty fun and rewarding experience. "

      "review": "If you want a big ol stinkin RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously on the Switch, Dragon Quest 11 is your game. It's really like 3 different games, or long chapters maybe. The 1st one being probably the best, the 2nd being a little sluggish, and the 3rd being the most ridiculous. I don't really remember the story too well, but I'm pretty sure there are aliens thrown in, and you turn into a fish at some point. There's also some secret level stuff where you play in 2D which is kinda fun. Speaking of 2D, you can toggle back and forth between 3D and old school 2D graphics on the fly which is pretty insane they have the game totally mapped out in both environments. As far as the art and music, all I can really say is 'Ehh'. It's just all kind of cheesy. And then you have the characters and enemies, which you just can't take seriously at all. One of the enemies is named 'Crabby Dabby Doo', which makes me feel like I'm getting beaten over the head by a minion. It's a dumb game. But it's also huge and fun and I wasted a ton of hours playing this. "

Maybe I'm not used to modern games that aren't Nintendo or indie, but my god there are a lot of menu screens. And the game being free, it's 99% unavailable. If you don't care about any of that and just go to the main game, it's kind of fun. I got tired of it quick though. I mostly played it out of curiosity of what the big deal was. They must have put me in with all the babies because I kept winning my matches, and I don't think I'm particularly good. Which kind of brings me to my next point - that the silliness of the costumes, and the freeness of the game, skews the whole ecosystem to much younger players. And honestly, I'd rather just let them have this one and stay out of the fort(nite)."

With its low/no-combat, cavern like aesthetics and old school tube-tv graphic style it captures a certain mood somewhere in between warm and creepy really well. The different animals throughout the world and their graphics and motions are really well done and interesting to see how you can interact with them. It's a fairly short game, and never quite leaves the initial aesthetics & mood the game starts with. But it's a unique & fun play that's one of the best indie games I've played in a long while. "

To which you'd then likely and justifiably slowly retreat into the bushes. For real though, it is a great game. Whoever did the sound design for Tetris Effect deserves a medal. Somehow the pieces falling into place always fit seamlessly with the music, and when you get a tetris, it always seems to happen exactly at the perfect moment in the melody's crescendo. Each level has it's own unique immersive theme. Sometimes you're underwater with the dolphins, sometimes you're in the bowels of some post industrial warehouse, sometimes space, or the jungle. It's a beautiful, atmospheric experience. But it is also just tetris. "

And of course it's always extremely disappointing when any game, especially one with such lo-fi graphics, start lagging or frame-dropping on the Switch. It wasn't frequent, but some parts were pretty bad, the mansion area being the worst. So yeah, the game did have some heart, but the execution really just was not there. "

      "review": "Oh hell yeah, this game was awesome! It's a fast paced gory slaughter-fest with some challenges thrown in. Music is great, art style is great. The levels are pretty long, so be prepared when you launch into one. It's the perfect game to play late at night where you can turn the lights down low and the music up high and mess some demons up. It took me a couple levels to get used to everything and feel like Doom 2016 was worthy of its namesake. But once I did, I was hooked. Definitely the most fun I've had in a FPS campaign in a long time. And thank you to the devs for keeping the story brief and the cutscenes non-existent. Only downsides I'd say was that it felt a little short, and the collectables were a little cheesy. "
